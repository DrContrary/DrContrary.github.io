# Background


### Cell Death Assay

Up to now we have been playing with some sample datasets that don't
really apply to our field specifically. Flowers, cars, and airplanes,
all make great examples, but it's harder to see how to directly apply
what you are learning in your daily workflow. So, to bring it back
directly to biology, we will be using some data that I collected.

**The Assay**

In this assay cells are stained with fluorescent dyes and then counted
on the microscope automatically. The total number of cells per image is
reported as either DAPI + (alive) or Sytox Green + (dead). This assay is
used to evaluate cell death directly in a 96-well culture dish.

**The Data**

-   replicates: n = 4
-   treatments: glucose dilution curve
    -   0.0g/L  
    -   1.0g/L  
    -   1.5g/L  
    -   2.0g/L  
    -   2.5g/L  
    -   3.0g/L  
    -   3.5g/L  
    -   4.0g/L  
    -   4.5g/L  
-   sheet 1: no myelin treatment  
-   sheet 2: myelin treatment
-   time point: single 24hr measurement

**Goals**

-   read in the data in excel book  
-   format the data  
-   add new variables  
-   perform statistics  
-   graph outputs

Data Import and Manipulation
============================

The readxl package is part of the tidyverse that we previously started
to explore. Remember that even though you installed the package
previously, you still have to load the library every time you want to
use it. For more information about the readxl package you can check out
the documentation
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf>

Change your working directory to where you are keeping your files for
this project.

    sytox_data <- read_excel("Sytox Data.xlsx", sheet = 1)
    head(sytox_data)

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 3
    ##   Source                              DAPI Sytox
    ##   <chr>                              <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Merged 24Hr No Mye 4.5 glucose.nd2   501   284
    ## 2 Merged 24Hr No Mye 4.5 glucose.nd2    74   324
    ## 3 Merged 24Hr No Mye 4.5 glucose.nd2   738    99
    ## 4 Merged 24Hr No Mye 4.5 glucose.nd2   751   701
    ## 5 Merged 24Hr No Mye 4.0 glucose.nd2  1209  1015
    ## 6 Merged 24Hr No Mye 4.0 glucose.nd2  1328  1016

You might notice that when we imported this data frame, the data class
that is returned is a tibble. Although we didn't explicitly state that
we wanted a tibble, this is the default import for the read\_excel()
function. If for some reason you felt so inclined, you could always
coerce this into a standard data.frame.

To perform the manipulations we need, we need to load in the tidyr and
dplyr packages that are part of the tidyverse. These will allow us to
tidy up our data: remember that this means that each observation is in
its own row with each variable in its own column. To get each variable in
its own column, we will use the separate() function to split the file
name into the variables we need.

*Had I thought ahead when naming the files in the first place, I would
have used better nomenclature. However, this is real data straight from
the microscope so we will deal with it just as it is.*

    sytox_data = sytox_data %>%
      separate(Source, into = c("drop", 'timepoint', 'treatment', 'myelin', 'glucose', "drop"), sep= ' ', remove = TRUE) %>%
      unite(mye.treatment, c("treatment", "myelin")) %>%
      select(-drop)

    head(sytox_data)

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 5
    ##   timepoint mye.treatment glucose  DAPI Sytox
    ##   <chr>     <chr>         <chr>   <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 24Hr      No_Mye        4.5       501   284
    ## 2 24Hr      No_Mye        4.5        74   324
    ## 3 24Hr      No_Mye        4.5       738    99
    ## 4 24Hr      No_Mye        4.5       751   701
    ## 5 24Hr      No_Mye        4.0      1209  1015
    ## 6 24Hr      No_Mye        4.0      1328  1016

To determine how many total cells we have and the percentage dead cells
per well we have to calculate some new variables. To do this we use the
mutate function. This function allows us to perform calculations on
specific columns that we define.

Here we create two new columns: "total\_cells" and "percent\_dead"

    sytox_data = sytox_data %>%
      mutate(total_cells = DAPI + Sytox) %>%
      mutate(percent_dead = (Sytox/total_cells)* 100)

    head(sytox_data)

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 7
    ##   timepoint mye.treatment glucose  DAPI Sytox total_cells percent_dead
    ##   <chr>     <chr>         <chr>   <dbl> <dbl>       <dbl>        <dbl>
    ## 1 24Hr      No_Mye        4.5       501   284         785         36.2
    ## 2 24Hr      No_Mye        4.5        74   324         398         81.4
    ## 3 24Hr      No_Mye        4.5       738    99         837         11.8
    ## 4 24Hr      No_Mye        4.5       751   701        1452         48.3
    ## 5 24Hr      No_Mye        4.0      1209  1015        2224         45.6
    ## 6 24Hr      No_Mye        4.0      1328  1016        2344         43.3

Summary Function
----------------

To get some summary information for plotting, let's use the summarize
function that we previously explored. Since we only have one time point
and a single treatment, we will group by glucose concentration.

    mean_stats = sytox_data %>%
      group_by(glucose) %>%
      summarise(percent_dead_mean = mean(percent_dead), sd_percent = sd(percent_dead))
    print(mean_stats)

    ## # A tibble: 9 x 3
    ##   glucose percent_dead_mean sd_percent
    ##   <chr>               <dbl>      <dbl>
    ## 1 0                    2.19      0.568
    ## 2 1.0                  3.87      1.60
    ## 3 1.5                  3.35      0.824
    ## 4 2.0                  4.26      1.63
    ## 5 2.5                  3.11      1.18
    ## 6 3.0                  2.61      1.25
    ## 7 3.5                  8.39      4.84
    ## 8 4.0                 36.6       9.67
    ## 9 4.5                 44.4      28.9

Use a bargraph to vizualize
---------------------------

So, it looks like there is a huge effect from glucose. Lets plot this
out to visualize.

    ggplot(mean_stats, aes(x= glucose, y =  percent_dead_mean)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=percent_dead_mean-sd_percent, ymax=percent_dead_mean+sd_percent),
                    size=.3,    # Thinner lines
                    width=.2,
                    position=position_dodge(.9)) +
      ylab("Percentage of Dead Cells") +
      xlab("Glucose Concentration") +
      labs(title = "Barplot of Data using ggplot2") +
      theme_bw()

Add the rest of the data from the second sheet
----------------------------------------------

It looks like there is something interesting going on here, but we also
want to know how the dead in untreated samples compares those treated
with myelin debris.

To do this, lets read in the second sheet in our book and perform the
same manipulations and combine it all into one large dataset. To get the
second sheet in our book, simply change the sheet argument to sheet = 2.

**Note:** There is no reason to perform all the manipulations step-wise
this time unless for teaching purposes. Notice that all of the
manipulations have been piped together. This is best practice and should
be done whenever possible.

    sytox_data2 <- read_excel("Sytox Data.xlsx", sheet = 2)

    sytox_data2 = sytox_data2 %>%
      separate(Source, into = c("drop", 'timepoint', 'treatment', 'myelin', 'glucose', "drop"), sep= ' ', remove = TRUE) %>%
      unite(mye.treatment, c("treatment", "myelin")) %>%
      select(-drop) %>%
      mutate(total_cells = DAPI + Sytox) %>%
      mutate(percent_dead = (Sytox/total_cells)* 100)

Bind the data together
======================

Now that our data is formatted consistently, lets bind it together so
that we can look at is as a whole. To do this we use the bind\_rows()
function. Think of this as basically stacking our data together.

After this we will run our summary functions again to look at everything
together.

    sytox_data_full = bind_rows(sytox_data, sytox_data2)

    mean_stats_full = sytox_data_full %>%
      group_by(glucose, mye.treatment) %>%
      summarise(percent_dead_mean = mean(percent_dead), sd_percent = sd(percent_dead)) %>%
      arrange(mye.treatment)  

**Note:** The arrange argument is used here to present the date grouped
by treatment rather than glucose concentration as default. It is only
for ease of viewing. Try removing the function to see what happens.

Use a bargraph to visualize the large set
-----------------------------------------

    ggplot(mean_stats_full,
           aes(x= glucose, y = percent_dead_mean, fill = mye.treatment)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
      geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=percent_dead_mean-sd_percent, ymax=percent_dead_mean+sd_percent),
                    size=.3,    # Thinner lines
                    width=.2,
                    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +
      ylab("Percentage of Dead Cells") +
      xlab("Glucose Concentration (g/L)") +
      labs(title = "Barplot of Data using ggplot2") +
      theme_bw()

### Future Directions

The data looks pretty good so far, but we still need to run some
statistics. Right now it looks like there might be an outlier or two
that is skewing our data, so we should test to see if we can remove it.
